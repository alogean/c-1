## 1. Physiology and Cerebral Adaptations

**APA Reference:**
Bain, A. R., Drvis, I., Dujic, Z., MacLeod, D. B., & Ainslie, P. N. (2021). Physiological limits to maximal breath-holding in humans. *Experimental Physiology*, 106(3), 595-608.

**Summary:**
The study analyzes the physiological limits of maximal apnea. It demonstrates that elite freedivers maintain cerebral oxygenation through a massive increase (+107%) in cerebral blood flow, compensating for the drop in oxygen saturation. The brain remains functional despite levels of hypoxia that would be critical for untrained individuals.

## 2. Training and Static Performance

**APA Reference:**
Viana, R. B., de Oliveira, V. V., Gentil, P., de Lira, C. A. B., & Vancini, R. L. (2022). Training methods for maximal static apnea performance: A systematic review and meta-analysis. *American Journal of Human Biology*, 34(10), e23703.

**Summary:**
This meta-analysis evaluates the effectiveness of different protocols. The results show that methods combining static apneas (tables) with physical training (cardio and strength) produce the best performance gains. Mental training is highlighted as a key factor in increasing tolerance to hypercapnia (CO2).

## 3. Cognitive Health and Hippocampus

**APA Reference:**
Ratzenböck, C., & Schöfl, G. (2025). Does freediving lead to hippocampal adaptability to hypoxia and maintenance of episodic memory?. *European Journal of Applied Physiology*.

**Summary:**
Conducted over 7 months of training, this research observed no loss of hippocampal volume or deficit in episodic memory among freedivers. This suggests that regular training develops neuroprotective mechanisms against intermittent hypoxia.

## 4. Predictive Factors of Performance

**APA Reference:**
Buttarelli, M., et al. (2024). Physical and physiological predictors determining the maximal static apnea diving time of male freedivers. *Frontiers in Physiology*.

**Summary:**
The study identifies that experience, high vital lung capacity, and high baseline oxygen saturation are the best predictors of performance. Conversely, a high stress index and excess body fat have a direct negative impact on apnea duration.

## 5. Psychological Adaptations (Novices)

**APA Reference:**
Kovacevic, J., et al. (2024). Physiological and psychological adaptations to 13 days of apnea training in novice apneists. *Journal of Sports Sciences*.

**Summary:**
Even over a short period (13 days), apnea training coupled with psychological coaching improves not only apnea time but also the stress response (Stroop test) and strengthens the reflex bradycardia. The mind acts as an accelerator of physiological adaptation.

## 6. Safety and Blackout Prevention

**APA Reference:**
Schagatay, E., Lodin-Sundström, A., & Abrahamsson, E. (2025). Hyperventilation detection system in freediving: proof of concept. *Frontiers in Physiology*, 15, 1498399.

**Summary:**
This article presents a system of thoracic sensors to detect pre-apnea hyperventilation. The results show that respiratory frequency and amplitude allow for the prediction of PETCO2 levels, offering a technological path to reduce the risks of syncope (blackout) via real-time alerting.

## 7. Oxidative Stress in Elites

**APA Reference:**
Mrakic-Sposta, S., et al. (2021). Effect of apnea-induced hypoxia on cardiovascular adaptation and circulating biomarkers of oxidative stress in elite breath-hold divers. *Antioxidants*, 10(9), 1418.

**Summary:**
The study shows that maximal apnea induces temporary oxidative stress. However, elite freedivers produce specific proteins (HSP27) that act as cardiovascular protectors, showing a deep biological adaptation to hypoxic aggression.
